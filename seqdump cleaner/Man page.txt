NAME

	seqdump_cleaner.py- cleans the blast result output file (seqdump.txt) according to the user's specification

SYNOPSIS

	seqdump_cleaner.py [-h] [-n x] [-o x] [-r x] [-u x]

REQUIRED PACKAGES

	Bio, textwrap, regex, argparse, os	

DESCRIPTION

	seqdump_cleaner.py takes the blast result seqdump file as an input and deletes sequences according to the user
	specifications to an output file. Both the input and output files are required arguments (-n and -o respectively).
	The seqdump file needs to be converted to fasta format, otherwise the script may not work. It can also cleave and 
	keep only the portion of the sequences that the user requires, the regex code for which needs to be encoded after 
	the -r argument. The -u argument lets the user choose which terms in the seq IDs would warrant the removal of the
	sequences. By default, IDs containing 'partial' and 'LOW_QUALITY' are removed.

OPTIONS

	-h, 	--help            	show this help message and exit
	-n x, 	--file_name x     	name of the input seqdump file (required argument)
	-o x, 	--output_file_name x    name of the output file (required argument)
	-r x, 	--regex_code x		the regex code to manipulate each of the sequences
	-u x, 	--unwanted_sequences x	terms/words, if found in FASTA ids, that would warrant the removal of the sequence [no more than three terms]	

EXAMPLES

	get rid of sequences with IDs containing 'partial' or 'LOW_QUALITY' 

	~$ python3 seqdump_cleaner.py -n seqdump.fasta -o col1a1_sequences.fasta -u partial,LOW_QUALITY

	get rid of sequences with IDs containing 'partial' and only keep sequences from the first letter after GLGGNFAP until YRA (needs regex)

	~$ python3 seqdump_cleaner.py -n seqdump.fasta -o col1a1_sequences.fasta -u partial -r "(?<=GLGGNFAP).+YRA"

NAME

	MultiFasta_digester.py takes a fasta file with many sequences and two taxa to compare. It then digests all
	the sequences from different species of each taxon and gives out the top most occurring peptides for each, 
	peptides unique to each other and peptides exclusive to each of the taxa.

SYNOPSIS

	MultiFasta_digester.py [-h] [-n x] [-m x] [-c x]

REQUIRED PACKAGES

	Bio, pyteomics, collections, argparse, regex

DESCRIPTION 

	The script takes the names of two taxa to compare as user inputs in the command line (e.g., Mammalia and Reptilia)
	and prints three outputs for each of the taxons. These are as follows: Common in most Mammalia, Present only in Mammalia,
	and Present in Mammalia but not in Reptilia. The three outputs for Reptilia are the same containing the corresponding 
	information about Reptilia. To be classed as conserved peptides at least 50% of the target taxon had to contain the given 
	peptide marker. This threshold was also kept at 50% to be classed as a unique peptide. Please make sure there is no comma
	after each taxon name (bovidae,leporidae instead of bovidae, leporidae).

OPTIONS

	-h, 		--help            	 show this help message and exit
	-n x, 	--file_name x     	 name of the input fasta file (required argument)
	-m x, 	--missed_cleavage		 number of missed cleavage allowed (By default no missed cleavage)
	-c x, 	--compare_taxa		 The required taxa to be compared (two)	

EXAMPLES

	Information about the taxa Bovidae and Leporidae from the file "COL1A2 Final_filtered.fasta" allowing no missed cleavage

	$ python3 "MultiFasta_digester (User input).py" -n "COL1A2 Final_filtered.fasta" -c Bovidae,Leporidae
	
	Information about the taxa "Sus scrofa" and "Bos taurus" from the file "COL1A1 Final_filtered.fasta" allowing one missed cleavage
	
	$ python3 "MultiFasta_digester (User input).py" -n "COL1A1 Final_filtered.fasta" -c "Sus scrofa","Bos taurus" -m 1
